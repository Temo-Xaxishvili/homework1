    <p>
      <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a
      <a href="#">website</a> for the <a href="#">Internet</a> (<a href="#"
        >World Wide Web</a
      >) or an <a href="#">intranet</a> (a private network).<sup
        >[<a href="#">1</a>]</sup
      >
      Web development can range from developing a simple single
      <a href="#">static page</a> of <a href="#">plain text</a> to complex
      <a href="#">web applications</a>, <a href="#">electronic businesses</a>,
      and <a href="#">social network services</a>. A more comprehensive list of
      tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include
      <a href="#">Web engineering</a>, <a href="#">Web design</a>,
      <a href="#">Web content development</a>, client liaison,
      <a href="#">client-side/server-side scripting</a>,
      <a href="#">Web server</a> and
      <a href="#">network security</a> configuration, and
      <a href="#">e-commerce</a> development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
      non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing
      <a href="#">markup</a> and <a href="#">coding</a>.<sup
        >[<a href="#">2</a>]</sup
      >
      Web development may use <a href="#">content management systems</a> (CMS)
      to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist
      of hundreds of people (<a href="#">Web developers</a>) and follow standard
      methods like <a href="#">Agile methodologies</a> while developing Web
      sites.<sup>[<a href="#">1</a>]</sup> Smaller organizations may only
      require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
      assignment to related job positions such as a
      <a href="#">graphic designer</a> or
      <a href="#">information systems</a> technician. Web development may be a
      collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a
      designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer
      specialization: <a href="#">front-end developer</a>, back-end developer,
      and full-stack developer.<sup>[<a href="#">3</a>]</sup> Front-end
      developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user
      browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<sup
        >[<a href="#">4</a>]</sup

      Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has
      become one of the most used technologies ever.

    <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>

    <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Tim Berners-Lee</a> created the
      <a href="#">World Wide Web</a> in 1989 at CERN.<sup
        >[<a href="#">5</a>]</sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the
      automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with
      institutions and various global organizations. Consequently,
      <a href="#">HTML</a> was developed in 1993.<sup>[<a href="#">6</a>]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view
      material and provide a small amount of information.<sup
        >[<a href="#">7</a>]</sup
      >
      Core protocols of web 1.0 were <a href="#">HTTP</a>, HTML and
      <a href="#">URI</a>.<sup>[<a href="#">8</a>]</sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Web 2.0</a>, a term popularised by
      <a href="#">Dale Dougherty</a>, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a
      2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage,
      emphasizing interactivity.<sup
        >[<a href="#">9</a>][<a href="#">10</a>]</sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved
      from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated
      network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a
      user-focused, read-write online network.<sup>[<a href="#">7</a>]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
    <p>
      Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was
      introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web.
      Key features include the integration of <a href="#">metadata</a>, precise
      information delivery, and improved <a href="#">user experiences</a> based
      on preferences, history, and interests.<sup
        >[<a href="#">citation needed</a>]</sup
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing
      more functionality than traditional search engines. Users can customize
      navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve
      identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating
      user profiles.<sup>[<a href="#">7</a>]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      This version is sometimes also known as <a href="#">Semantic Web</a>.<sup

    </p>

    <h3>Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
    <p>
      The journey of web development technologies began with simple
      <a href="#">HTML</a> pages in the early days of the internet. Over time,
      advancements led to the incorporation of <a href="#">CSS</a> for styling
      and <a href="#">JavaScript</a> for interactivity. This evolution
      transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting
      the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web
      development process can be divided into sequential steps. They mentioned
      different aspects of analysis.<sup>[<a href="#">17</a>]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      Phase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can
      effectively achieve its goals. Keil et al.'s research<sup
        >[<a href="#">18</a>]</sup
      >
      identifies the primary reasons for software project failures as a lack of
      top management commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. To
      mitigate these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and
      objectives, designing a system to fulfill them. The decision to establish
      a web presence should ideally align with the organization's corporate
      information strategy.
    </p>

    <p>The analysis phase can be divided into 3 steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Development of a web strategy</li>
      <li>Defining objectives</li>
      <li>Objective analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      During this phase, the previously outlined objectives and available
      resources undergo analysis to determine their feasibility. This analysis
      is divided into six tasks, as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Technology analysis:</b> Identification of all necessary
        technological components and tools for constructing, hosting, and
        supporting the site.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Information analysis:</b> Identification of user-required
        information, whether static (web page) or dynamic (pulled "live" from a
        database server).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills analysis:</b> Identification of the diverse skill sets
        necessary to complete the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>User analysis:</b> Identification of all intended users of the site,
        a more intricate process due to the varied range of users and
        technologies they may use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cost analysis:</b> Estimation of the development cost for the site or
        an evaluation of what is achievable within a predefined budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Risk analysis:</b> Examination of any major risks associated with
        site development.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Following this analysis, a more refined set of objectives is documented.
      Objectives that cannot be presently fulfilled are recorded in a Wish List,
      constituting part of the Objectives Document. This documentation becomes
      integral to the iterative process during the subsequent cycle of the
      methodology.<sup>[<a href="#">17</a>]</sup>
